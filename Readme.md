**Author:** GITAHIMUTHOMI  
**Course:** Web Development  
**Topic:** JavaScript Functions, Loops, and DOM Manipulation

## üß† Overview

This project demonstrates my understanding of **core JavaScript fundamentals**, including:
- Variables and conditionals  
- Functions and reusability  
- Loops and iteration  
- DOM manipulation for interactivity  

It consists of a simple interactive webpage that allows users to:
1. Enter their name and age to see a message (Part 1)  
2. Perform addition and multiplication using reusable functions (Part 2)  
3. Generate a dynamic list using a loop (Part 3)  
4. Toggle between light and dark themes (Part 4)

## üß© Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | The main structure and content of the webpage |
| `style.css` | Styling for layout, colors, and dark mode |
| `script.js` | All JavaScript code demonstrating variables, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation |
| `README.md` | Documentation describing the assignment and what each part does |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features Implemented

### Part 1: JavaScript Basics
- Captures user input (name, age)
- Uses **conditionals (if/else)** to display messages
- Demonstrates basic data types and logic flow

### Part 2: Functions
- Implements **two custom functions**: `addNumbers()` and `multiplyNumbers()`
- Promotes **reusability** and clean, DRY code

### Part 3: Loops
- Uses a **for loop** to generate numbers dynamically
- Displays results directly on the webpage

### Part 4: DOM Manipulation
- Uses **event listeners** and **class toggling**
- Dynamically changes theme (light/dark)
- Updates content and elements on the fly
